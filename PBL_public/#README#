This code uses weak lensing data and produces the map of dimensionless surface mass density. 

This directory contains sub directories

This has a makefile that links to lower level directoris.

This code uses JAMA, TNT.
You can download these codes from here,
http://math.nist.gov/tnt/download.html
In the Makefile in PBL_public change path= "path to your TNT,JAMA files"

Directories:
bin:executable directory.
arxiv: This has older codes.


src/pbl: This directory has all the codes for PBL. 



bin/recon_pbl executes the PBL codes.

The code is run as follows:
"bin/recon_pbl pbl.config"

Files:

The format for the config files is,
// This code will take a configuration file of the form:
  // 1. datafile (containing column delimited x y e1 e2 sigma_e)
  // 2. int constsigma (0 to use the parameters in the datafile, 
  //                    1 to use the parameter in line 3)
  // 3. double sigma_e (if constsigma=0, then this number is thrown away)
  // 4. Eta
  // 4a. niter
  // 5. output filename
  // 6. idx associated with h (e.g. h=h1*rho0^(-0.5)/(rho/rho0)^idx), idx=0.5 means constant noise
  //                                             idx=0.=constant length
  // 7. h1, the length scale associated with a density of "1".  
  // 8. The number of modeled isothermal spheres assumed for the initial conditions
  // 9-11, 12-14, ..., xc, yc, theta_e for each of the isothermal spheres


The .dat files contain data of the for "x,y,e1,e2" for 1 peak and 2peaks.
If you want to test codes it is best to use these files foe testing.

The output has the form,
x,y,psi,kappa,ktrue

Of course if you have your own shear catalog that can be used as well. One thing to remember all codes are written for unit grid. So the x,y-s for a general shear catalog need to be normalized to unity.
