These codes are used to generate the shear catalog.

The catalog is generated on a unit grid.

one_iso.pro: generates one softened isothermal sphere
two_iso.pro: generates two peaks of softened isothermal sphere

find_images.pro uses 'find_clump.pro','calculate_ellipticity.pro' to make the catalog.
